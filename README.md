______ is a performance and installation that combine live and pre-retrieved data. 
The space is set up with three screens, which show a Unity environment of a parallel universe with digital bodies.
All of the dummies were animated using Motion Capture, some are being shown with  pre-retrieved data, and some with live data input.
The participants enter the physical space and are able to control each camera in Unity with their phone's gyroscope, via OSC.
While that happens, the performer moves live in the space, controlling two of the models in Unity.

This repository contains the scripts to send data from the gyroscope's on the participants phones to Unity. 

Here, you can access all the files, which include:
- Scripts to send data from the gyroscope's on the participants phones to Unity
- Unity project, with the environment and models
- Blender files, with the environment design

Also, this is the plugin used for connecting Zigsim to Unity, in order to use the gyroscope data
